#### Introduction

This lab is modelled to highlight how acid rain affects the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of lakes. Acid precipitation results from the combustion of fossil fuels which produce oxides of sulfur and nitrogen that react in the earth’s atmosphere to form sulfuric and nitric acid. [(1)](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Rain/Acid_Rain.html] ) The lab report shows the results from two seperate labs, [Lab 1](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Rain/Acid_Rain.html#experimental-objectives) and [Lab 2](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Neutralizing_Capacity/Acid_Neutralizing_Capacity.html#procedures). In Lab 1, the data collected were lake samples in 5 minutes intervals over a 20 minutes time period as an acid rain storage was pumped at a constant flow rate into a modelled lake. This was done in order see the change of pH over time and calculate ANC. In Lab 2, the samples collected in Lab 1 used to determine the ANC of each sample.

The observations of the lab were to be used as supporting evidence that that is possible.

The equations that were used for this lab report:

$$ANC_0 = [ANC_{out} - ANC_{in} (1-e^{-t/\theta})]e^{t/\theta}$$

$$ANC =2[CO_{3}^{2-}]+[HCO_{3}^{-}]+[OH^{-}]-[H^{+}]$$

$${F_1} = \frac{{{V_S} + {V_T}}}{{{V_S}}}{\text{[}}{{\text{H}}^ + }{\text{]}}$$

 $$ANC=\frac{V_e N_t }{V_s }$$


#### Objective
The goal for this lab is to gather experimental data to determine that remediation of lake can be obtained by increasing the ANC added so pH can be at an acceptable level and maintained over a desired period. The lab used sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3, to be the source of ANC.

This was achieved by adding NaHCO3 to the lake surface and pumping acid rain at a pH of 3. The pH of the lake was then monitored over a 20 minutes time frame.

#### Procedure

The detailed procedure for Lab 1 can be found [here](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Rain/Acid_Rain.html#procedures), and the Lab 2 procedure can be found [here](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Neutralizing_Capacity/Acid_Neutralizing_Capacity.html#procedures).

In Lab 1, a pre-calculated mass of NaHCO3 was weighed out and added into a 4 L lake that had a stirrer bar inside. The stirrer bar was placed to model the lake as a completely mixed flow reactor, CMFR. A pH probe was placed in the lake to measure the change over a course of 20 minutes. In 5 minute intervals, a 100 mL sample of the lake was taken, labelled and set aside. The samples were kept to be used later in Lab 2.

In Lab 2, the 5 different samples were used to perform titrations in order to find the equivalent volume. The titrant used was 0.05 N HCl. The pH probe recorded the data necessary for ProCoDA to create Gran plot analysis.


#### Data Analysis

As mentioned previously, the NaHCO3 was used as the ANC supplement for the lake. Figure 1 clearly shows the pH levels decreasing over time after the ANC was added at t = 0. The area on the graph with the slower change in pH is because of the buffering effect of bicarbonate ions reacting with hydrogen ions to form carbonic acid.

$$  [HCO_3^- ] + [H^+] \rightarrow [H_2CO_3]$$

**Figure 1:** pH versus hydraulic residence time.

If enough NaHCO3 were added to the lake to maintain an ANC greater than 50μeq/L for 3 residence times with the stirrer turned off, some of it will dissolve the water while some of it will sink to the bottom due to the greater density of NaHCO3 than water. The water in which some of the NaHCO3 dissolved in more dense than the rest of the water and it will also sink. Therefore, as the acid is added the pH will be different throughout the lake. The pH will be lower at the source of the acid, at the top of the lake, and higher farther away, at the bottom of the lake. A second experiment was conducted in Lab 1 where the mass of NaHCO3 was doubled. By doubling the ANC added, the pH took a longer time to drop. This is because there was a higher buffer capacity, causing the lake to acidify at a slower rate.

CaCO3 is another carbonate that was tested to see the effect it could have for lake remediation. There are some problems that could be encountered if CaCO3 were used to remediate acid rain in a lake. The solubility of the CaCO3 is very low in water. Therefore, it might not work to just add in a lot of it at the same time. Instead if a steady amount was added during the during of the acid rain, the solubility might not be a problem. If all of the CaCO3 is added at the same time, a lot of it will not go into solution but rather settle at the bottom. The effect of this is that the ANC will not use the full potential of the CaCO3 added.


The samples taken in the Lab 1 at five minute intervals were titrated to find the equivalence volume. Figure 2 displays the pH as a function of the volume of titrant added into the lake at t=0. At t=0, the sample is expected to be the most basic solution as NaHCO3 was just added, therefore the equivalent volume would be the largest. The equivalent volume is found from the excel file of data from ProCoDA. The equivalence point is defined as the point in the titration where titrant volume that has been added equals the “equivalent” volume (Ve). The equivalence point is a good way to determine ANC.

**Figure 2:** Titration curve of the t=0 sample with 0.05 N HCl

There are 3 notable regions of figure 2. As labeled the first region is where bicarbonate ions react with hydrogen ions and form carbonic acid. There is a steep slope that occurs at the equivalent volume and the third region is where the hydrogen ions contribute directly to the decrease in pH.

**Figure 3:** Gran Plot data from the titration curve of the t=0 sample

Similarly, figure 3 is a Gran plot at t=0. In the collected data, there is a first Gran function, F1, attributed to each data point. F1 is defined as a straight line. $${F_1} = \frac{{{V_S} + {V_T}}}{{{V_S}}}{\text{[}}{{\text{H}}^ + }{\text{]}}$$
The abscissa intercept is the equivalent volume. Both figure 1 and 2 clearly show that the ProCoDa equivalent volume for sample t = 0 is 0.831005 ml. This is basically the same as the calculated equivalent volume of 0.8310051 ml.

**Figure 4:** Measured ANC of the lake at different states



In figure 4, there are four different ANCs being plotted. The conservative ANC is from assuming the lake is a CMFR and ANC is a conservative species.

$$ANC_0 = [ANC_{out} - ANC_{in} (1-e^{-t/\theta})]e^{t/\theta}$$

$$ANC_{out}= \frac {ANC_0}{e^{t/\theta}} + ANC_{in} (1-e^{-t/\theta}) $$

The nonvolatile ANC is from the assumption that is no carbonates exchanged with the atmosphere during the experiment. The volatile ANC is from assuming there is carbonate exchange with the atmosphere and that the carbonates are at equilibrium with the atmosphere. The ANC measured points are the data points found from doing titrations of the lake samples at five minute intervals during the experiment. The graph shows that the ANC measured partially agrees with the conservative ANC model but agrees move with the nonvolatile ANC model.

### Conclusion

After looking at the titration curve for the t=0 sample, we were able to see two regions of slow change in pH. The first region corresponds to the buffering effect of HCO3 which becomes H2CO3 as it adds a proton and the second corresponds to a region where hydrogen ions contribute directly to the change in pH. The equivalent volume is seen in the region of this graph where there is a steep change in pH. We calculated an equivalent volume that was very close to the ProCoDa value and this is seen in the linear part of the Gran function. The measured ANC over the duration of the experiment is similar to the conservative ANC model but deviates towards the volatile ANC model. This experiment showed us how carbonate species can act as a buffer to prevent the decrease in pH associated with acid rain in lakes.

### Suggestions

One change that could be made to the lab is when doing the titrations. We were able to same time when doing the titrations in the beginning by putting in larger amounts of titrant in order to get an idea of what the equivalent volume was. Then on the second try we were able to put in smaller increment of titrant once we were approaching the that equivalent volume. By doing this we were able to get an idea of how much titrant would be needed in each titration.
