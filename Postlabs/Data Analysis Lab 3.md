#### Introduction

This lab is modelled to highlight how acid rain affects the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of lakes. Acid precipitation results from the combustion of fossil fuels which produce oxides of sulfur and nitrogen that react in the earth’s atmosphere to form sulfuric and nitric acid. [(1)](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Rain/Acid_Rain.html] ) The lab report shows the results from two seperate labs, [Lab 1](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Rain/Acid_Rain.html#experimental-objectives) and [Lab 2](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Neutralizing_Capacity/Acid_Neutralizing_Capacity.html#procedures). In Lab 1, the data collected were lake samples in 5 minutes intervals over a 20 minutes time period as an acid rain storage was pumped at a constant flow rate into a modelled lake. This was done in order see the change of pH over time and calculate ANC. In Lab 2, the samples collected in Lab 1 used to determine the ANC of each sample.

The observations of the lab were to be used as supporting evidence that that is possible.

The equations that were used for this lab report:

$$ANC_0 = [ANC_{out} - ANC_{in} (1-e^{-t/\theta})]e^{t/\theta}$$

$$ANC =2[CO_{3}^{2-}]+[HCO_{3}^{-}]+[OH^{-}]-[H^{+}]$$

$${F_1} = \frac{{{V_S} + {V_T}}}{{{V_S}}}{\text{[}}{{\text{H}}^ + }{\text{]}}$$

 $$ANC=\frac{V_e N_t }{V_s }$$


#### Objective
The goal for this lab is to gather experimental data to determine that remediation of lake can be obtained by increasing the ANC added so pH can be at an acceptable level and maintained over a desired period. The lab used sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3, to be the source of ANC.

This was achieved by adding NaHCO3 to the lake surface and pumping acid rain at a pH of 3. The pH of the lake was then monitored over a 20 minutes time frame.

#### Procedure

The detailed procedure for Lab 1 can be found [here](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Rain/Acid_Rain.html#procedures), and the Lab 2 procedure can be found [here](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Neutralizing_Capacity/Acid_Neutralizing_Capacity.html#procedures).

In Lab 1, a pre-calculated mass of NaHCO3 was weighed out and added into a 4 L lake that had a stirrer bar inside. The stirrer bar was placed to model the lake as a completely mixed flow reactor, CMFR. A pH probe was placed in the lake to measure the change over a course of 20 minutes. In 5 minute intervals, a 100 mL sample of the lake was taken, labelled and set aside. The samples were kept to be used later in Lab 2.

In Lab 2, the 5 different samples were used to perform titrations in order to find the equivalent volume. The titrant used was 0.05 N HCl. The pH probe recorded the data necessary for ProCoDA to create Gran plot analysis.


#### Data Analysis

As mentioned previously, the NaHCO3 was used as the ANC supplement for the lake. Figure 1 clearly shows the pH levels decreasing over time after the ANC was added at t = 0. The area on the graph with the slower change in pH is is because of the buffering effect of bicarbonate ions reacting with hydrogen ions to form carbonic acid.

$$  [HCO_3^- ] + [H^+] \rightarrow [H_2CO_3]$$

This observation exactly matched expectaions

**Figure 1:** pH versus hydraulic residence time.

The samples taken in the first lab at five minute intervals were titrated to find the equivalence volume.

We learned that by doubling the ANC added, the pH took a longer time to drop. This is because there was a higher buffer capacity, causing the lake to acidify at a slower rate. (from lab 2 data analysis)

Figure 2 displays the pH as a function of the volume of titrant added into the lake at t=0. At t=0, the sample is expected to be the most basic solution as NaHCO3 was just added, therefore the equivalent volume would be the largest. The equivalent volume is found from the excel file of data from ProCoDA. The equivalence point is defined as the point in the titration where titrant volume that has been added equals the “equivalent” volume (Ve). The equivalence point is a good way to determine ANC.

**Figure 2:** Titration curve of the t=0 sample with 0.05 N HCl

There are 3 notable regions of figure 2. As labeled the first region is where bicarbonate ions react with hydrogen ions and form carbonic acid. There is a steep slope that occurs at the equivalent volume and the third region is where the hydrogen ions contribute directly to the decrease in pH.

**Figure 3:** Gran Plot data from the titration curve of the t=0 sample

Similarly, Figure 3 is a Gran plot at t=0. In the collected data, there is a first Gran function, F1, attributed to each data point. F1 is defined as a straight line. $${F_1} = \frac{{{V_S} + {V_T}}}{{{V_S}}}{\text{[}}{{\text{H}}^ + }{\text{]}}$$
The abscissa intercept is the equivalent volume. Both figure 1 and 2 clearly show that the equivalent volume for sample t = 0 is 0.831005 ml. This is approximately the same as the calculated equivalent volume of 0.79ml. This was determined.....

**Figure 4:** Measured ANC of the lake at different states

In figure 4, there are four different ANCs being plotted. The conservative ANC is from assuming the lake is a CMFR and ANC is a conservative species. The Nonvolatile ANC is from the assumption that is no carbonates exchanged with the atmosphere during the experiment. The Volatile ANC is from assuming there is carbonate exchange with the atmosphere and that the carbonates are at equilibrium with the atmosphere. The ANC measured points are the data points found from doing titrations of the lake samples at five minute intervals during the experiment. The graph shows that the ANC measured partially agrees with the conservative ANC model but deviates towards the Volatile ANC model. 

**-Present results in a clearly labeled format. Data analysis methods, equations, graphs, and tables should be presented in this section. The report text should refer to each equation, figure, and table. Include a table of relevant experimental parameters (e.g., measured flow rates, sample sizes, concentrations of reagents, etc.).
-Compare theoretical expectations with your results and discuss reasons for any observed deviations. If the results weren't as expected, suggest reasons why the laboratory results may have differed from theory and suggest improved techniques to obtain more accurate results or modifications to the theory to better describe the experimental conditions.
-Make sure that responses to specific questions and data analysis requested in the lab manual are included in this section. But don't answer the questions in a list format. Instead, include your answers as part of the narrative that is designed to meet your objectives.**


### Conclusion

After looking at the titration curve for the t=0 sample, we were able to see two regions of slow change in pH. The first region corresponds to the buffering effect of HCO3 which becomes H2CO3 as it adds a proton and the second corresponds to a region where hydrogen ions contribute directly to the change in pH. The equivalent volume is seen in the region of this graph where there is a steep change in pH. We calculated an equivalent volume that was very close to the ProCoDa value and this is seen in the linear part of the Gran function. The measured ANC over the duration of the experiment is similar to the conservative ANC model but deviates towards the volatile ANC model. This experiment showed us how carbonate species can act as a buffer to prevent the decrease in pH associated with acid rain in lakes.

**The conclusions section should not include any new observation. It is the place to summarize the results in a few sentences. Make sure you connect your conclusions to your objectives for doing the research.**

### Suggestions

One change that could be made to the lab is when doing the titrations. We were able to same time when doing the titrations in the beginning by putting in larger amounts of titrant in order to get an idea of what the equivalent volume was. Then on the second try we were able to put in smaller increment of titrant once we were approaching the that equivalent volume. By doing this we were able to get an idea of how much titrant would be needed in each titration.

**I value your thoughts on where changes are needed as well as what is working well. Please provide very clear ideas that I can add to the lab manual or change in how we run the lab. Include ideas for: improving the data acquisition software
modifying the experimental apparatus (Explain what you would like to change and why)
making the experiment easier to understand (provide proposed change to the lab manual)
modifying the experiment to include some new experimental aspect related to the main topic
alternate ways to analyze the data (As we build better tools we can do cooler analysis!)**
