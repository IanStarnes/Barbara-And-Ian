#### Introduction

This lab is modelled to highlight how acid rain affects the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of lakes. Acid precipitation results from the combustion of fossil fuels which produce oxides of sulfur and nitrogen that react in the earth’s atmosphere to form sulfuric and nitric acid. [(1)](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Rain/Acid_Rain.html] ) The lab report shows the results from two seperate labs, [Lab 1](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Rain/Acid_Rain.html#experimental-objectives) and [Lab 2](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Neutralizing_Capacity/Acid_Neutralizing_Capacity.html#procedures). In Lab 1, the data collected were lake samples in 5 minutes intervals over a 20 minutes time period as an acid rain storage was pumped at a constant flow rate into a modelled lake. This was done in order see the change of pH over time and calculate ANC. In Lab 2, the samples collected in Lab 1 used to determine the ANC of each sample.

The observations of the lab were to be used as supporting evidence that that is possible.

The equations that were used for this lab report:

$$ANC_0 = [ANC_{out} - ANC_{in} (1-e^{-t/\theta})]e^{t/\theta}$$

$$ANC =2[CO_{3}^{2-}]+[HCO_{3}^{-}]+[OH^{-}]-[H^{+}]$$
$${F_1} = \frac{{{V_S} + {V_T}}}{{{V_S}}}{\text{[}}{{\text{H}}^ + }{\text{]}}$$

The ANC can be calculated from the equivalent volume from $$ANC=\frac{V_e N_t }{V_s }$$


**Why did you decide to do this experiment? Introduce your approach by explaining what needs to be done to meet your goal for your real world project. Explain what you hoped to learn through this research. How did you expect this experiment to guide your decisions about the real world project that you are working on? This is the section where you can present the equations that you will be using. Format the equations using Latex to create a beautiful report.**

#### Objective
The goal for this lab is to gather experimental data to determine that remediation of lake can be obtained by increasing the ANC added so pH can be at an acceptable level and maintained over a desired period. The lab used sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3, to be the source of ANC.

This was achieved by adding NaHCO3 to the lake surface and pumping acid rain at a pH of 3. The pH of the lake was then monitored over a 20 minutes time frame.

#### Procedure

The procedure for Lab 1 can be found [here](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Rain/Acid_Rain.html#procedures), and the Lab 2 procedure can be found [here](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Acid_Neutralizing_Capacity/Acid_Neutralizing_Capacity.html#procedures).

**Provide an overview of the methods that you used in your investigation. The best procedures give an overview of the method with an explanation of why you used those methods. There is no need to restate the step-by-step procedures as outlined in the lab manual: it is sufficient to cite the lab manual and include information on any deviations from the manual procedures. When method development is part of the laboratory exercise, a detailed description of the methods should be included. Methods and procedures need to be detailed enough so that one of your classmates could duplicate your work.**

#### Data Analysis



<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/barbaraoramah/my-CEE4530/blob/master/images/gran_t=0.png?raw=true" heights=310 width=927> </p>

**Figure 1:** Titration curve of the t=0 sample with 0.05 N HCl

Figure 1 displays the pH as a function of the volume of titrant added into the lake representing the acid rain. The equivalent volume is found from the excel file of data from ProCoDA. The equivalence point is defined as the point in the titration where titrant volume that has been added equals the “equivalent” volume (Ve). The equivalence point is a good way to determine ANC

 bicarbonate to carbonic acid is:

 $$ [HCO_3^-] to [H_2CO_3]  $$







The calculated Ve (0.79 mL) is approximately the same as the ProCoDa Ve (0.813005  mL).

**-Present results in a clearly labeled format. Data analysis methods, equations, graphs, and tables should be presented in this section. The report text should refer to each equation, figure, and table. Include a table of relevant experimental parameters (e.g., measured flow rates, sample sizes, concentrations of reagents, etc.).
-Compare theoretical expectations with your results and discuss reasons for any observed deviations. If the results weren't as expected, suggest reasons why the laboratory results may have differed from theory and suggest improved techniques to obtain more accurate results or modifications to the theory to better describe the experimental conditions.
-Make sure that responses to specific questions and data analysis requested in the lab manual are included in this section. But don't answer the questions in a list format. Instead, include your answers as part of the narrative that is designed to meet your objectives.**


### Conclusion

We learned that by doubling the ANC added, the pH took a longer time to drop. This is because there was a higher buffer capacity, causing the lake to acidify at a slower rate. (from lab 2 data analysis)

**The conclusions section should not include any new observation. It is the place to summarize the results in a few sentences. Make sure you connect your conclusions to your objectives for doing the research.**

### Suggestions
**I value your thoughts on where changes are needed as well as what is working well. Please provide very clear ideas that I can add to the lab manual or change in how we run the lab. Include ideas for: improving the data acquisition software
modifying the experimental apparatus (Explain what you would like to change and why)
making the experiment easier to understand (provide proposed change to the lab manual)
modifying the experiment to include some new experimental aspect related to the main topic
alternate ways to analyze the data (As we build better tools we can do cooler analysis!)**
