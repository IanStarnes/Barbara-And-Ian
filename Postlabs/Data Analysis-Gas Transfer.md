### Lab exploration

1. ProCoDa switches from the “prepare to calibrate” state to the “calibrate” state when the pressure below the prerdefined threshold.

2. ProCoDA switches from the “calibrate” state to the “Pause” state when the pressure in the accumulator reaches 60% of the source pressure. During the “Pause” state both valves are closed.

3. The “Pause” state knows which state to go to next because the “Pause” state stops when the elapsed time in the current state (“pause” state) is greater than the calibrate to aeration lag, then the next state is set to “Aerate”.

4. The equation that is used to calculate the maximum calibration pressure is (source pressure) * (max cal/ source). This equation better than using a constant for the maximum calibration pressure because our source pressure is not constant.

5. ProCoDA calculates the predicted pressure in the accumulator when it is filled at a constant mass flow rate by using the constant “(R*T/V)” and “Delta P” ( max cal pressure – min cal pressure) to calculate the “fill time”. This variable is used along with max calibration pressure and min calibration pressure to plot the air fill model.

6. The inputs to the “air valve control” are the air slope and the air flow rate.

7. “Air valve control” controls the solenoid valve which controls the air flow rate in our system and the two states that use it are “aerate” and “fill accumulator”.

8. Jonathan saw our program execute properly.


### Data Analysis

This lab will use the power of python to
streamline repetitive data analysis. Use the data from the entire class for the analysis. You can use for loops to cycle through all of the data sets.

8. Comment on the oxygen transfer efficiency and the trend or trends that you observe.

As the air flow rate increases, the oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE) decreases. As the flow rate increased, it observed that the air bubbles in the system increase in size, thus reducing the surface area to volume ratio for gas transfer. Additionally, the speed of the bubbles increased. This means that the the time of each bubble spent in the reactor decreased. With this in consideration, the bubbles at a higher flow rate do not transfer o

9. Propose a change to the experimental apparatus that would increase the efficiency.

A change that would increase the efficiency of the experiment would be using a deeper reactor. This would allow the bubbles to stay within the reactor for a longer period of time.

Make sure to keep the DO probe is close to the bottom of the reactor. This will make sure that there are no air bubbles covering the DO probe which will affect the data that is collected


### Conclusion



### Suggestion
Make sure to keep the DO probe is close to the bottom of the reactor. This will make sure that there are no air bubbles covering the DO probe which will affect the data that is collected
