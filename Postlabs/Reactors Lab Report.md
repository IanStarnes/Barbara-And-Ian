#### Introduction

Reactors can be found in chemical, biological and physical processes all around the environment. Reactors can be defined by as real or imaginary boundaries and closed and open, such as a lake or a section of a river, respectively.

There are different types of reactor models. The most common idealised models are the batch reactor model, completely mixed flow reactor (CMFR) model, flow with dispersion (FDR) model and plug flow reactor (PFR) model. Important parameters for the reactors are the mixing level and residence time, which affect the degree of process reaction that occurs.

A CMFR model is well-mixed and are modeled by a mass balance to determine the concentration of the tracer

The advection dispersion is
**Advection Dispersion model and CMFR need to be defined**

The Peclet number is a dimensionless number that determine 

$$ Pe = \frac {advective \space transport \space rate}{diffusive \space transport \space rate} $$

#### Objective
The objective for this experiment was to create different set-up to curate experimental data to see the different characteristics of a reactor. The measured data is compared with a CMFR model as well as an advection dispersion model to see how the models align. The analysis of this data will help in designing a chlorine contact tank which should optimize the contact time between the chlorine and any pathogens in the water.

#### Procedure
The detailed procedure for the lab can be found [here](https://monroews.github.io/EnvEngLabTextbook/Reactor_Characteristics/Reactor_Characteristics.html#procedures)

Following the cited lab procedure, we ran 6 different reactor experiments over a span of 2 lab sessions.

From test 1 to test 5, all the experiments used a consistent reactor volume of 0.00254 m3. Additionally the flow rate was kept the same at 380 mL/min (100 RPM).

###### Test 1: CMFR
Test 1, the reactor is modeled as a CMFR with a stirrer in the center on a high speed. The concentration for the tracer is 100 g/L and the volume added was 765 microliters.

###### Test 2: Two baffles with 2 holes of 7.74 mm diameter (taped)

Test 2 is a reactor where we used 2 baffles that was taped around the edges with Gorilla Glue Tape. The baffles were placed on the opposing side of the reactor at equidistances. The tape was used to ensure that the dye only travelled through the holes in the baffles. The concentration for the tracer is 100 g/L and the volume added was 400 microliters.


###### Test 3: 4 baffles with 2 holes of 7.74 mm diameter (taped)

Test 3 has the same set up as test 2 however this experiment used 4 baffles as opposed to 2. The red dye that was added however had a concentration of 10g/L and we added the tracer volume of 800 microliters.

###### Test 4: 4 baffles no hole

Test 4 used 4 baffles that had no holes and were 14 cm in width. The reactor has a width of 15.3 cm, therefore was 1.3 cm of space. The baffles were placed on alternating sides of the reactor and were taped with the Gorilla Glue Tape. The tracer concentration used was 10 g/L and a volume of 800 microliters was added.


###### Test 5: 7 random baffles but evenly spaced (no tape)

Test 5 consisted of seven baffles that varied in different number of holes and diameters. They were evenly spaced within the reactor and were not taped down. The tracer concentration used was 10 g/L and a volume of 800 microliters was added.


#### Results

The time for 10% of the pulse to arrive at the effluent of a CMFR is approximately 0.1 tâ‹†. The closer the value of t_star is to 1 represents that the tracer had a long residence time in the reactor.

#### Data Analysis

A total of 5 different models were tested. This allows for an abundance of data to compare. The data will be presented individually and at the end of the data analysis is where differences and similarities of different models will be more carefully analysed.

<b>Figure 1 </b>: CMFR - Test 1

The CMFR model almost perfectly agrees with the measured dye effluent concentration as expected.

<b>Figure 2 </b>: Two Baffles - Test 2
</p>


For the experiment, two baffles were used that have 4 holes of 7.74 mm diameter vertically aligned were placed so that the holes would be on alternating sides of the reactor. With 2 holes of 7.74 mm diameter under the water line, the data is modeled most accurately by the CMFR model. This is seen in the beginning of the experiment, where the CMFR model more closely aligns with the measured data during the initial spike in dye in the effluent.

<p align="center"> <b>Figure 3 </b>: Four Baffles - Test 3 </p>

For the experiment with four baffles with alternating orientation, again with 2 holes of 7.74 mm diameter under the water line, the data is modeled well by both the CMFR and AD model. However, the CMFR model expected the dye to leave the reactor slightly more quickly that it did.

<b>Figure 5 </b>: Four Baffles with no holes - Test 4
</p>

For this experiment four baffles of a different type were used. These baffles forced the flow to go around the baffle on alternating sides of the reactor. The AD model more accurately represents the measured dye for this reactor.

There are some dead zones in this test. The dye is not completely mixed in the reactor. Figure 6 is a clear visual of the lack of mixing that occurred in the reactor.

<p align="center">
<b>Figure 7 </b>: Seven Baffles - Test 5
</p>

In this experiment a random assortment of seven baffles was used. Again, the AD model more accurately fits the measured data.

<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/IanStarnes/Barbara-And-Ian/blob/master/Reactor%20Characteristics%20Photos/IMG_1236.JPG?raw=true" heights=110 width=427> </p>

<p align="center">
<b>Figure 8 </b>: Images of seven baffles
</p>

As Figure 8 shows, there is short circuiting in the reactors. This is best seen at the edge of the baffles because they were not taped on the sides with Gorilla Glue Tape. The

The number of reactors used in the CMFR model and the Peclet number from the AD model were similar for each reactor. The N and Pe increased from the CMFR to the 2 Baffles and increased from the 2 baffles to the 4 baffles. However, the 4 baffles had a larger N and Pe than the 4 baffles that did not have holes but rather was like a conventional chlorine contact tank. The seven baffles had lower N and Pe than 4 baffles, but this is likely due to the sides of the seven baffles not being tapes which caused short circuiting and random baffles being used instead of baffles with alternating sides with holes. So, the higher the Peclet number, the less dispersion and therefore, the reactor with 4 baffles with holes had the least dispersion.

The value of t* at F = 0.1 for the CMFR is 0.085. This is close to the expected value of 0.01 for a CMFR. For the two baffles the value of t* at F = 0.1 was 0.35. This is a pretty good improvement from the CMFR. However, the four baffles was even better at a t* = 0.64. This was the largest value out of all of our reactors. The four baffles with no holes was slightly lower at t* = 0.44. Finally, the seven baffles had a t* = 0.32. All these values are expected from the data we got about the N and Pe numbers.

The ratio of tracer to hydraulic residence time was less than one for all of the reactor as expected. This was the upper limit for chlorine contact tanks. Our four baffles reactor had a decent value of 0.84. This was the second best value, with the best value for the seven baffles. Since these values are less than the one, that means that there are dead zones or certain areas in the reactor that are not used. This causes the effective volume to be less than the volume of the reactor.


#### Recommendation

Full scale chlorine contact tank are typically designed as figure 9. The relative concentration of chlorine decreases as it goes through the baffle curtain system.

<p align="center"> <img src="http://www.pretechnologies.com/thumb-w659-h484-images/chlorine-concentration-original-CFD.png" heights=110 width=427> </p>

<p align="center">
<b>Figure 9 </b>: Chlorination contact tanks
</p>

Based off the results in our tests, the best recommendation for a full scale chlorine contact is test 3. Test 4 follows a similar design but the flow is more constricted through the reactor. Test 4 had the highest t_star value which shows that the tracer spent the longest time in the reactor. Other tests paled in comparison for varying reasons. The CMFR model for example had the lowest t_star value which is not ideal as the water would not have high contact efficiency, thus lack of chlorination.


#### Conclusion

This lab highlighted the different parameters of a reactor and how they can significantly effect the efficiency of each reactor. The reactors with more baffles closely followed an advection dispersion model. Moreover, test 3 had the highest Peclet number which further supports the statement. The experiments that were taped were the most efficient as it prevented short circuiting occur in our system, which would reduce the t_star value at f = 0.1. The reactor that had the best t_star value at f = 0.1 was the reactor for four baffles that has holes on one side of the baffle. The baffle hole were on alternating sides to force the flow to have the longest path. Therefore, we suggested this reactor for a chlorine contact tank.


#### Suggestions

This lab for the most part ran very smoothly. The main difficulty for this lab was taping the Gorilla Glue Tape to the sides of the baffles.

The photometer must be handled with great care, and a suggestion we have is make sure it is on and that you check the data you obtain from _ProCoDA_ to matches what is currently being observed in the experiment. If you believe that is not the case, there is a likelihood that there is an air bubble and you can lightly tap it to remove it.
