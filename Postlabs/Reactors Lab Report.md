#### Introduction

Test 1:
Reactor Volume = 0.00254 m3
Red dye conc = 25.8 mg/L
(we put in 765 microliters)
Flow rate =  380 ml/min
(100 RPM)

Bucket alone = 560g
Bucket with water = 3097g

Test 2: Two baffles with 2 holes of 7.74 mm diameter

- opposing sides of the reactor
- funky data cut it at around 4:25 pm

Reactor Volume = 0.00254 m3
Red dye conc = 13 mg/L
(we put in 400 microliters)
Flow rate = 380 mL/min

Bucket alone = 492g
Bucket with water = 3075g
