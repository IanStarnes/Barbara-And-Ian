#### Introduction

Test 1: CMFR no baffles just a stirrer on high speed
Reactor Volume = 0.00254 m3
Red dye conc = 25.8 mg/L
volume of red dye = 765 microliters
Flow rate =  380 ml/min
(100 RPM)

Bucket alone = 560g
Bucket with water = 3097g

Test 2: Two baffles with 2 holes of 7.74 mm diameter (taped)

- opposing sides of the reactor
- funky data cut it at around 4:25 pm

Reactor Volume = 0.00254 m3
Red dye conc = 13 mg/L (from 100 g/L of red dye)
volume of red dye =  400 microliters
Flow rate = 380 mL/min

Bucket alone = 492g
Bucket with water = 3075g

3/13
Note to self: remember to turn on photometer so you can read your data
Test 3: 4 baffles with 2 holes of 7.74 mm diameter (taped)

Reactor Volume = 0.00254 m3
Red dye conc used = 10 g/L
Volume of red Dye = 800 microliters

Bucket alone =  557 g
Bucket with water = 3139 g

Final measured concentration = -1.02 mg/L

Test 4: 4 baffles no hole, 14 cm in length and the reactor is 15.3 cm )taped

Observations: There are some dead zones in this test. The dye is not completely mixed in the reactor

Reactor Volume = 0.00254 m3
Red dye conc used = 10 g/L
Volume of red Dye = 800 microliters

Bucket alone =  557 g
Bucket with water = 3099 g

Final measured concentration =  -1.08 mg/L


Test 5: 7 random baffles but evenly spaced (no tape)
baffles vary in different number of holes and diameters


Observations: we observed some side slip through the edges of the baffles because we did not tape the sides

Reactor Volume = 0.00254 m3
Red dye conc used = 10 g/L
Volume of red Dye = 800 microliters

Bucket alone =  557 g
Bucket with water = 2985 g

Final measured concentration = -0.3 mg/L

Test 6: PLUG FLOWW

Observations:

length = 12.5 ft
ID = 3/8th inch
Reactor Volume = m3
Red dye conc used = 10 g/L

Observation: test 1 we had the two pumps and then we removed the tubing that would pump in the influent.

Volume of red Dye = 1000 microliters
Diluted with 22 mL of water


Final measured concentration = 0 mg/L (assumed there is no dye)
