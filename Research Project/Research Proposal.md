##### Introduction

What is the problem? Why is it important?

The focus of this research will be testing the effect of filtration of activated carbon and sand with differing diameter sizes. This will

Activated carbon is charcoal that is treated with oxygen to open up million of pores in the carbon atom. This feature is what makes activated carbon a desirable material in filter as it has a large surface area that can adsorbs different chemicals.


##### Objectives
What is the hypothesis? What will you do to test the hypothesis?

Our hypothesis is that the smaller the activated carbon mesh sizes we use, the better the filter will perform. This is because the particles will have a great surface area to volume ratio that will allow more red dye to be adsorbed on to the surface. For the smaller mesh sizes, the red dye will take longer to reach the center of the activated carbon particle.


##### Experimental plan
How will you measure it?

We will vary the type of activated carbon to see how the mesh size effects the filtration efficiency. This can be measured the same was as was done in the absorption lab with the photometer. Additionally, time and resources permitting, we will vary the type of sand we use, the ratio of sand to activated carbon, and flow rates. The efficiency will again be measured with the photometer.

Key design parameters

1. Activated Carbon - different mesh sizes
2. Sand - different types
3. varying ratio of sand and activated carbon
4. flow rates ?

(in order of what we will vary time and amount of activated carbon dependent)

##### Timeline of tasks/experiments

1. Confirm our experiment with Prof. Weber Shirk

2. Order the activated carbon online

3. Set up workstation

4. Run experiment with different mesh sizes

5. Run experiment with different sands

6. Run experiment with different ratios of sand and activated Carbon

7. Data analysis - dispersed between experiments

##### Possible hurdles/challenges

We might to run experiments overnight depending of the set up.

We might need to back wash to reuse the AC.

We plan to add sand to previous experiments to vary the AC to sand ratios.

##### Resources needed to conduct experiments – What tools will you use?

Materials:

  Activated Carbon:
- untreated, granular, ≤5 mm (500g - $36.60)
- untreated, granular, 8-20 mesh (500g - $37.60)
- powder, -100 particle size (mesh), decolorizing (175g - $48.00)

  or

- DARCO®, 4-12 mesh particle size (250g - $44.30)
- DARCO®, 12-20 mesh, granular (250g - $44.30)
- DARCO®, 20-40 mesh particle size, granular (250g -$45.50)
- DARCO®, −100 mesh particle size, powder (250g - $45.80)

- Sand (varying diameter ?)

- Red Dye #40
- Reverse Osmosis Water
- A bunch of T-valves
- Pump
- Peristaltic Tubing
- Activated Carbon Filter
- Photometer

##### Expectations/Anticipated results

For smaller mesh activated carbon the efficiency of the filter will be less than that of larger mesh activated carbon. This is due to the red dye taking longer to reach the center of the for larger particles. For the different types of sand we anticipate better filtration for the smaller sand particles. For higher AC to sand ratios we anticipate higher efficiencies. For lower flow rates we anticipate higher efficiencies.

Experimental Set-Up

20% Activated carbon(20-40 mesh size) by mass
80% sand
Mixed together

Mass of sand = 121.975 g
Multiply sand by 0.25 to get mass of AC
Mass of activated carbon = 30.493 g

75.156g mass remaining of mixed ration


Main issue faced: air bubble in our system 











**Brainstorming**
- Like looking at turbidity
- grinding down some AC and seeing how the different sizes of AC will be
- get sludge from ithaca beer brewery
- wastewater

volumes
concentration
etc.
things that are varying
