Write your research proposal in Atom. You can begin defining variables and calculating parameters as you design your proposed research. This research proposal can then evolve into your final report.

Intro/context – What is the problem? Why is it important?
Objectives – What is the hypothesis? What will you do to test the hypothesis?
Experimental plan including – How will you measure it?
Key design parameters
flow rates
volumes
concentrations
range of parameters that you are varying
etc.
Timeline of tasks/experiments
Possible hurdles/challenges
Refs to primary, review, and other literature and possibly to previous years’ projects
Resources needed to conduct experiments – What tools will you use?
Expectations/Anticipated results
References/Bibliography



**Brainstorming**
- Like looking at turbidity
- grinding down some AC and seeing how the different sizes of AC will be
- get sludge from ithaca beer brewery
- wastewater
