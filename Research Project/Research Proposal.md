Write your research proposal in Atom. You can begin defining variables and calculating parameters as you design your proposed research. This research proposal can then evolve into your final report.

##### Intro/context
What is the problem? Why is it important?

Testing the effect of filtration of activated carbon with differing diameter sizes. This is important as it c


##### Objectives
What is the hypothesis? What will you do to test the hypothesis?

Prediction that the larger the activated carbon is, the larger

##### Experimental plan including – How will you measure it?
Key design parameters
flow rates
volumes
concentrations
range of parameters that you are varying
etc.
Timeline of tasks/experiments
Possible hurdles/challenges
Refs to primary, review, and other literature and possibly to previous years’ projects
Resources needed to conduct experiments – What tools will you use?
Expectations/Anticipated results
References/Bibliography



**Brainstorming**
- Like looking at turbidity
- grinding down some AC and seeing how the different sizes of AC will be
- get sludge from ithaca beer brewery
- wastewater
