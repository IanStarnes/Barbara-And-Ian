#Filter Efficiency of different mesh sizes of Activated Carbon
### Research Project Report
#### Ian Starnes and Barbara Oramah
##### Group 6

## Introduction and Objectives

###### Write a paragraph on the goals of the experiment. Why did you decide to do this experiment? Introduce your approach by explaining what needs to be done to meet your goal for your real world project. Explain what you hoped to learn through this research. How did you expect this experiment to guide your decisions about the real world project that you are working on?

###### This is the section where you can present the equations that you will be using. Format the equations using Latex to create a beautiful report.

The goal of this experiment was to test several filter that have different size particles of activated carbon.

## Procedures

###### Provide an overview of the methods that you used in your investigation. The best procedures give an overview of the method with an explanation of why you used those methods. There is no need to restate the step-by-step procedures as outlined in the lab manual: it is sufficient to cite the lab manual (use a link to the url) and include information on any deviations from the manual procedures. When method development is part of the laboratory exercise, a detailed description of the methods should be included. Methods and procedures need to be detailed enough so that one of your classmates could duplicate your work.

###### Include the actual values that you measured for volumes, masses, flow rates, etc. For example, if the lab manual suggested 267 mL/min for the flow rate and you measured 310 mL/min, then you report the 310 mL/min in procedures.

## Results and Discussion

###### Present results in a clearly labeled format. Data analysis methods, equations, graphs, and tables should be presented in this section. The report text should refer to each equation, figure, and table. Include a table of relevant experimental parameters (e.g., measured flow rates, sample sizes, concentrations of reagents, etc.).

###### Compare theoretical expectations with your results and discuss reasons for any observed deviations. If the results weren't as expected, suggest reasons why the laboratory results may have differed from theory and suggest improved techniques to obtain more accurate results or modifications to the theory to better describe the experimental conditions.

###### Make sure that responses to specific questions and data analysis requested in the lab manual are included in this section. But don't answer the questions in a list format. Instead, include your answers as part of the narrative that is designed to meet your objectives.


## Conclusion

###### The conclusions section should not include any new observation. It is the place to summarize the results in a few sentences. Make sure you connect your conclusions to your objectives for doing the research.

## Suggestions

###### I value your thoughts on where changes are needed as well as what is working well. Please provide very clear ideas that I can add to the lab manual or change in how we run the lab. Include ideas for:

###### improving the data acquisition software
###### modifying the experimental apparatus (Explain what you would like to change and why)
###### making the experiment easier to understand (provide proposed change to the lab manual)
###### modifying the experiment to include some new experimental aspect related to the main topic
###### alternate ways to analyze the data (As we build better tools we can do cooler analysis!)

## Appendix

###### Put all of the python code in the Appendix at the bottom of the report. Ideally make this one block of code with comments so that it can both be understood and be executed all at once.

###### You can use the Lab Manual as an example of a well formatted document. The Atom reports should have similar formatting with the required python code.
